mimosa-require-testem
=====================

A RequireJS based implementation of Testem support for Mimosa

Design notes, pay no attention

* attempt spawn with testem ci
* inline the test results, simple output format if possible, keep minimal
* need mimosa test command for detailed results
* Ideally make configless with config options in mimosaconfig rather than testem.json, -f config file location
